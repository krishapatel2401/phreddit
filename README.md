# Phreddit

**Phreddit** is a full-stack Reddit-style web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to create communities, post content, comment on posts or replies, and manage profiles. Admin users have additional privileges to manage users and content.

The project includes:
- User authentication using **JWT**
- Community and post management
- Nested comment support
- Role-based views (admin vs. regular user)
- Basic unit testing for client and server components
